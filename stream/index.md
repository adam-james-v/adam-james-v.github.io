I stream programming sessions 4 days per week. Each day is roughly earmarked for different types of work:

## Monday - Library Work
[Stylo](https://github.com/adam-james-v/stylo) is a document rendering library I am writing in Clojure. It is *very much* a **Work In Progress**.

## Tuesday - Design Work
I'm building Stylo as a tool to help me with design work. I enjoy designing and building things like computer cases, furniture, and exercise equipment. As time continues, I want to flex and stretch my design and engineering skills with more advanced designs.

## Thursday - Learning and Practice
As a self taught developer I feel the need to deliberately practice computer science and engineering concepts. I also recognize a need to keep my mechanical engineering skills sharp. Showcasing and creating code and documents about such topics should keep things nice and fresh.

## Friday - Silly Little App
A programmer that never creates anything is probably less effectiev than they could be. As a mechanism to prove to myself that I can finish projects regularly, I have *Silly Little Apps* session to have fun while getting work done.
