&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been spending a lot of time this past year figuring out what I can do with my career. I've been really struggling through the pandemic times to understand myself and how I can live happily in this world while still facing challenges and 'stepping up' to solve problems and be as good a person as I can be. It's a tall order, and if I'm honest with myself I've been spinning my wheels a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been steadily working on Clojure libraries for 2D and 3D programmatic CAD, but I have not been pushing forward as much as I think I can. Nor have I been working with much urgency or focused direction. To a degree I am being gracious with myself; it was a hard year for many people, and I must confess it was hard for me too. But I'm not making excuses, just recognizing where I'm at. If I want to build the career I'm envisioning, I've got to step up my efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One area I know how to improve is my code quality. I'm ready to step beyond alpha-level libraries and into releasing real tools. It's time to stop prototyping and time to start solidifying. I want to be known as a developer who cares about his code and his tools. I will strive to be a programmer with high quality code standards and consistently good output. That's doable for sure, but I need a clear idea of what 'high quality' actually looks like as I write my libraries and applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;What Others Have to Say&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;I asked about signifiers of high quality Clojure(script) code on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RustyVermeer/status/1433114900306350081"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and received a few replies. In particular, I am intrigued by David Nolen's suggestion that a high quality library has:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very little change over a long period of time (years)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preferably no breaking changes in that whole time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which I think implies that the library writer must signal that their code is &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;well planned&lt;/em&gt;. These are excellent criteria, yet are quite subjective and open-ended. In order for a library to be reliable, it must indicate both what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; do. In order for a library to be considered stable, it must demonstrate reliability over time by continuing to successfully do what it did before. Basically, if you want your code to be high quality, you have to &lt;em&gt;design it&lt;/em&gt;, and you have to &lt;em&gt;mean it&lt;/em&gt;. You've got to deliver on your design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect each developer and team builds a rather intuitive understanding of these goals as they gain experience, but there are also many tools that programmers can use to help. Metrics are rarely the whole story, but they can provide a useful proxy for the more subjective elements of work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vikram Rangnekar pointed me to &lt;a href="https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dosco/graphjin"&gt;Go Report Card&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dosco/status/1433212685160574978"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; as a perfect example of how one can use tools to help build a set of metrics for assessing your code's (proxy) quality. I'll be using this site as an example when improving my own measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, Vincent Cantin listed his main criteria as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple API&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;very few or no side effects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;does not do more than needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is another set of excellent and open-ended criteria. What truly counts as 'simple'? Is 5 'very few', or perhaps 3? How can you know for sure what is needed from a library? These, I think, are all answerable questions, but the interesting thing is that they are all context dependent. You cannot definitively say what a Simple API is without knowing what you want your API to accomplish. Very few side effects may actually be a rather large number if the side effects are the point of the library. Once again, we see that a design is a rather crucial element of high quality code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that I have some insights from other people, I want to share some of the criteria I've come up with. These are ideas I hope to incorporate into my workflow going forward. I'm pushing myself hard this month to step up my programming skills, and these criteria are an important part of that effort.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Easy Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's nice to find some low-hanging fruit when building a set of criteria. Here are the things I know I can easily do that will improve the quality of my code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add doc-strings to my functions and namespaces. These show up in tooling and let anyone reading my code know the intended use for functions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run a code formatter and linter while editing my code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use git branches for feature development and bug fixing. Stop doing all of my development on the main branch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use GitHub Issues to document and discuss bugs and design questions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep functions small, and don't worry about 'too many functions', it's probably fine. But, delete code regularly too. Clutter isn't helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only use macros when you really know they'll be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write Stuff Down. Preferably in a spot you'll remember and see often. This is why I use org-mode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Simple Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also know of a few other elements that can positively impact my code quality. These are simple, but not necessarily easy to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain a thorough design document. Keep the scope tight and very clear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a clear understanding of what will NOT be included in the library or program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a list of minimum-required features needed for the code to be useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep a Change Log&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep a readme and keep it updated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create examples for all kinds of use-cases from simple to complex. Make sure the examples are easy to use via copy-paste and git cloning. Make it easy for a new user to try them out, perhaps even in the browser if that is possible and makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve my tooling. Fix up weird annoyances with Emacs, properly learn paredit, get Clj-Kondo running, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use my libraries for real work as I'm building (dogfooding). For example, use Forge to work on design docs and 3D models even before it's complete. This should help me discover truly required features and uncover bugs or faulty assumptions in my design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add features carefully and slowly. Delete code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automate the annoying bits. This means having good, clear scripts and instructions for things like building artifacts, pushing to Clojars, running tests, doing dev. and prod. builds, and generating documentation sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;High Quality from a High Level&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've touched on this already, but it's clear to me that high quality code is a subjective goal. That doesn't make in unimportant. In fact, I think the subjective goals are often the ones we have to pay more attention to, as they're subject to the 'out of sight, out of mind' problem. Maybe that's the real secret to high quality code: paying attention to what you're doing and why you're doing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, I want to try internalize the ideas Rich Hickey talks about in the well-known Hammock talk. In particular, I want to remember his simple definition of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/f84n5oFoZBc?list=PLZdCLR02grLrEwKaZv-5QbUzK0zGKOOcr&amp;amp;t=377"&gt;&lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Analysis and Design is about two things: Identifying some problem that we're trying to solve, and assessing our proposed solution in terms of whether or not it solves that problem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easier said than done, but I'm not actually looking for easy, I'm looking to make a difference. So, I need to practice the skill of identifying problems and solving them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make a few things a bit concrete, I'll have to remember to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;State the problem I'm solving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write down potential solutions, and write down the questions you have relating to the solution's implementation details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research and write down the answers you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there's no answer out there, validate and try things out yourself. &amp;quot;I don't know... let's find out!&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write down the problems in your solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Critique other people's solutions to the same problems, not because they're wrong, but because you'll uncover new questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think. A lot, and with pen and paper. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iterate over and over. Writing down your thoughts, discoveries, and decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get away from the computer. Do the thinking and design work in a quiet, distraction-free environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have concrete questions and specific issues to chew on, and think about these things hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is always the case, the best results take real effort. There's no quick and easy approach to  building high quality software. There are elements that can be automated, parts of the work that are easy, concepts that are simple, and skills that are clear enough to exercise. However, to really be a high quality developer, I know that I have to focus and put in the thinking effort. I need to design, solve, and iterate with a clear and focused eye on &lt;em&gt;solving real problems, &lt;/em&gt;and that's hard work worth doing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Support&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you want to support my work, you can provide a one time donation here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://ko-fi.com/adamjames"&gt;https://ko-fi.com/adamjames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or you can become a Patron of mine here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/adam_james"&gt;https://www.patreon.com/adam_james&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Support is never required by me, and anything I write or produce publicly (not explicitly as a paid product) is always free to consume with no obligation or expectation. I want to be a maker and a creator, and much of the time sharing work is reward enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, we live in a world where money is very important, and I won't lie and say I don't need some. If you feel so inclined to share a donation, just know that I am extremely grateful.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;I have two Clojure libraries underway for my code CAD endeavours: &lt;a href="https://github.com/adam-james-v/forge"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; for 3D models and &lt;a href="https://github.com/adam-james-v/svg-clj"&gt;svg-clj&lt;/a&gt; for 2D drawings. I have put more attention into the svg library because it’s an excellent balance of coding challenge and design utility. Thinking about my work so far, I realize a few reasons why starting in the 2D CAD world has been beneficial. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First, it’s simpler to implement. As a self-taught developer, I am rather cautious when assessing my abilities and knowledge. Im confident that I can learn necessary concepts, but not sure on how long things might take. Still, doing is better than speculating when it comes to building knowledge and skills, so I had to start somewhere, and a 2D library felt like the right place. Proving some of my ideas with a 2D library gives me confidence as I design my 3D library. And it turns out a lot of geometry concepts are essentially identical when looking at 2D/3D, so maths, data structures, code design patterns, and functions can be ported or used directly in my 3D work. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second, 2D modelling is powerful even without 3D. It’s amazing what can be communicated with only 2D diagrams. I would argue that for many real-world objects, you don’t even need 3D models to fully communicate a design. Well drawn 2D views really help the designer focus the reader on a few key details. Multiple views, slices, and styles can bring the intent of a design to the forefront.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many manufacturers’ shop floors are full of detailed design drawings that feature exclusively 2D diagrams. If you’ve ever thrown together a workbench with some 2-by-4s, you might already be familiar with the “scribble it on scrap paper” technique, which barely needs accurate form at all. I’ve made design plans with nothing more than dots, lines, and dimensions. Having a library to help make crisp, consistent, and parametric 2D diagrams is already a big win in my eyes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I was first learning CAD I assumed that 3D modelling was superior to 2D. That it was the final power in the skill tree of engineering design tools. It turns out not to be the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third observation I’ve had while working on my svg library has been that both 2D and 3D models have their place in a designer’s workflow. The model building process uses each as the “primitives” for the final design. You literally build up 3D models with 2D sketches, and then go on to produce 2D views from those 3D objects. In the realm of a design model, a primitive is a primitive, no matter how many dimensions it has. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, these are just a few observations I’ve made while working on my CAD libraries. It’s been on my mind as I start planning the next phase in my software development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s time for me to write a solid design doc for each library. Time for me to build a real-deal program that lets people interact with my work. It’s time to go 3D. It’s time to go interactive!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m mostly talking to myself in this one. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don’t think our world can sustain the status quo any longer. It’ll be the poor that suffer first and most, but everyone but the richest people are in for a tough ride. I think we all know this, and I don’t want to use this post to despair. I want to inspire myself towards action. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I want a better, more equitable society. But to get there I do have to “play ball” with what we have now, and I think I’ve been trying to avoid that for the past year. I hate capitalism and the perverse incentives that stem from its relentless pursuit of “growth“ and profit. Yet I need to live and survive. So I feel this internal conflict, hating the part of myself that pursues money, while knowing it’s wrong and inequitable. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But survive I must, and so I will seek power to make change. Or die trying. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ok, but practically speaking, what does this mean I’m doing? To be honest: I don’t (entirely) know, but I have to try figure it out. At least I’m starting with a few ideas and enough action to give it a go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pragmatic Part&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I’m building a business around programmatic CAD tools because I think we need designers and builders working on technologies designed by and for the people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hardware that is open and repairable. Devices and objects that save lives in climate crises, like filters, shelters, and tools. Technologies for the middle class to promote better collective action, like systems and infrastructure that promote car-free living. Technologies and concepts that force us to address the long term problems we know are coming, like renewable energy device manufacturing plants, and affordable (free, heaven forbid!) homes for climate refugees. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am using Clojure to build open source libraries for 2D and 3D modelling. With these libraries I can build sites, apps, and programs for small creators and designers. For example, I create PDFs of 2D quilt patterns, and I am expanding that workflow into its own app for quilt designers. I am similarly working on a set of prototype design scripts to prove the 3D model workflows that I hope to use for my own designs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As these libraries solidify, I will be able to automate technical design work for small manufacturers, and ensure for myself some recurring revenue. With this revenue I will be able to provide some consumer facing open source design programs, which I hope can promote a big community shift towards open design for all. CAD for the people. Hardware for humans. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As all of this grows, I will continue creating content exploring the technical and philosophical concepts related to my work. This is in part because I love sharing knowledge and promoting discussion about technical topics and partly to keep my work in the open where people can interact with me and take concepts as their own. Solutions to big challenges require multiple perspectives and approaches. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over the years, I hope to have enough money to buy myself a nice property to build a workshop on. This is the selfish part. I love building stuff and really want my own shop. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinking less selfishly, I want to build shops that others can use and I want to invest in businesses for minorities. I don’t work alone, and the world needs better communities. While capitalism still reigns, we need companies that actually care, and I want to be one such company that can also support other like minded groups.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don’t know how any of this will actually end up, but I know that I’ll shrivel up and die if I try to do my career in a “traditional” and “safe” way. I simply do not abide authority (within reason, I do strive to be a good citizen of the earth), and so I refuse to subject myself to office life. Nor do I accept the path we are collectively on. The time for platitudes and slow change is long gone, and I work for the future, not the past. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hope Part&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We need clear minds and open hearts to make a difference. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am consciously learning to get out of the way. There are many things worth fighting for and I am just one man. I don’t know everything, and have huge blind spots. Tech alone will not save us, it’s actually part of the problem much of the time. Uncaring, uncritical trust in technology and it’s overlords is what got us here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Community and leadership and brave politics are critical. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am only one man, and not that smart anyway. So I am learning to be humble and open to those who know policy and theory and fight for the people. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Community is key. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can help a bit in that regard. I love to share knowledge, and intend to keep doing so by creating programming, engineering and design  content on the internet (blogs, videos, open source projects, and streams). I have a small hope that I can start doing charity streams too, to help push money and awareness into spots of power. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As my career develops, I suspect that I will be ok (I’m a white male with well-off parents), and don’t have much to worry about for my individual well-being. Assuming some moderate success, I hope to expand my sights. If I can build a good business from good CAD tools, I want to work with manufacturers that share my vision and urgency about climate crisis solutions. I want to build better factories, better homes, and better farms. I want to create learning environments that can teach people to be makers again and give people the skills and confidence to fix and advance their own community environments. Free people from the grasp of closed tools built by uncaring and inhuman corporate machines. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Individual action is not enough, but there’s nothing that can stop me from individually dedicating my life to fighting for the climate, fighting for humans. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am starting small and working humbly as just one engineer. It’s not perfect but it’s a start. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I worked as an mechanical engineer and designer, I became very familiar with CAD software like AutoCAD and SolidWorks. Both are powerful tools for building complex and detailed models and they have their justified place in many design teams. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It’s not free software, though, and your design models don’t export cleanly to other formats. If you are building a library of models in proprietary software, you become slave to that vendor. They set the price for access to your designs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is true that you can always export to neutral formats (STEP for 3D, DXF or PDF for 2D), but anyone who has used CSV files to transfer database information to/from Excel will know that neutral formats don’t always work perfectly. If you have a picture of a page from a book, you can read the words but you cannot edit them without first transcribing it yourself. Your designs will be yours, but if you stop paying your license fees, your model library becomes much harder to access and edit. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think of design models as an attempt to describe the &lt;em&gt;platonic ideal&lt;/em&gt; of a concept. We can perfectly describe the concept of a circle’s form with its centre, radius, and a definition (a circle’s edge is always exactly 1 radius distance away from its centre), but we can’t actually manufacture perfect circles. An engineer might argue that “good enough” is actually perfect for the requirements, but let’s not muddy the waters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point is that when we model a design we are attempting to communicate its form and purpose as generally as possible while still being specific as to how it meets requirements. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is this &lt;em&gt;design essence&lt;/em&gt; that I think should be open. This design source should be always accessible so that we can more readily use and adapt it as requirements change and new ideas accrue. Or, if a project is abandoned, the source can remain as an artefact for history. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is one major benefit of programmatic CAD. The design source is essentially just text. If you write your designs in an open language with open source libraries, you will always have the ability to compile your designs into useful models and drawings, even when people leave projects or your software tools change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can even build these open tools into an existing closed workflow. If you keep the source open, you can compile design snapshots into proprietary formats and use your existing design approaches. With the right dev skillset, it is even possible to write new compilers for new proprietary software that the industry switches to later, all while maintaining control of and access to your design source. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That is the ideal which I hold in my head as I work on my code CAD tools. I don’t expect code CAD to revolutionize design software and it doesn’t eliminate the actual challenges of engineering and design, it just eliminates one source of risk (vendor lock-in) while simultaneously providing flexibility at the front of your design workflows. Naturally, you do end up with a kind of “skill lock-in” as designers need to be programmers or have programmers on the team, but it turns out that modelling and design skills are not so different from the necessary programming skills anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, if we eliminate the need for skill and deliberate thinking in the workplace, we won’t really have to worry about these things anyway, we will have solved work and can instead relax!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, I will happily use code as part of my design process. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t do well in office work. I don’t do well on the shop floor after a long day of drudgery. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do extremely well working on a creative project. I thrive when I’m working on something for myself or for a friend. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess I hate authority, and I loathe incompetent, unthinking managers and bosses. Incompetent colleagues can be helped, but managers must be avoided. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basically, I work extremely hard but only when I get to define “work” and set the scale for “hard”.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do not dream of labor. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I often wonder why people at my previous jobs in design and engineering were so obsessed with productivity. And not even a good, clear, measurable productivity, just a vague idea of people working long and working hard. It was crushing. Even those who claimed to be the hard workers had their limits, and in fact were often the least able to perform any of the critical tasks. If they disappeared for a week, nothing changed. But when the welders left, the trusses didn’t ship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the boss is gone, the work goes on.&lt;br&gt;When the welders leave, the bosses grieve. &lt;br&gt;— Adam and his silly “poetry”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What is the purpose of productivity improvement to such people? Improving productivity is, at best, a way to potentially achieve more future productivity. At worst it is a justification for cruelty towards and abuse of the workers, an ego boost for management, and a power trip for tyrannical employers; it’s probably a mix of all of these things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relentless pursuit of “productivity” turns companies into uncritical, unthinking machines morphing humans into replaceable cogs; erasing the value of our lives and replacing it with “growth” and cash flow. It’s disgusting and pointless. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Productivity for the purpose of doing more work forever is utter foolishness. It’s not actually what people want, it’s a way to hold power and keep control. But it’s not worth it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When you want to be productive &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of also being productive &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;, the simplest and most energy efficient approach is to just… not do anything. Don’t try to be productive!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But that’s not how our capitalist world works. We as individuals need to live. So, we must be “productive “ at work to survive. But it doesn’t really help us thrive. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I love working hard and being productive in my own framework, and I will work hard for the rest of my life. But it won’t be for bosses. It will be for me, and more importantly for my community. Be productive for the community, because the community is a multiplier, we help one another. And we are productive not for it’s own sake but for the well-being of the community. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Your boss doesn’t care about real productivity. They don’t want you to define work; but you can and you must. We have to work as communities, because “productivity” burns our future to maintain an idea of the past that never existed and doesn’t care about you or your present circumstances. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Productivity”: Burning the future to maintain the past while ignoring the present&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Be productive for the community if you can. Work hard for &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt;, if you wish it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Care for others and build your community, because your bosses won’t, and the modern machines of work will kill us all. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I work on and think a lot about design tools - code based CAD in particular. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I originally stumbled upon the concept of using written code to create 2D and 3D models years ago when I was searching around the web for open source and free modeling software to use for side projects. OpenSCAD was what I discovered and I was &lt;em&gt;fascinated. &lt;/em&gt;It became the gateway into programming for me. And I loved it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I discovered the power of code as a language for communicating intent, constraints, and ideas in a very dense yet consistent manner, and loved that it made my designs both more flexible and more consistent. Text and a basic rendering environment, though not necessarily &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, are certainly &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to full featured CAD environments such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to think of myself as a craftsman, but realistically speaking I suspect I’m only crafty on the weekends. Throughout my days I recognize the need for and satisfaction in a simple, straightforward approach; one of a tradesperson. And I think code based CAD is a wonderful tool for the modern trades: it requires knowledge and skill to use, but a competent user wields it quickly and efficiently without much fuss or ceremony. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Code CAD isn’t meant to be glamorous. It’s meant to be powerful, functional, and flexible without getting in the way of the real work, which in most practical settings is some tangible product, not merely a flashy render. I love a great model, but there’s very little that beats a set of technical drawings with grease and oil stains and pencil markups. I think programmatic CAD can strike a good balance here and be a real value added tool for design. At least, that’s the way I’m adding it into my work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is only one of my opinions about programmatic CAD, but I think it’s a useful way of thinking about the tool. Code is just another option we have when working on designs; it is not the end goal, and it is not necessarily superior or fitting in every case. But we don’t deny the importance of a hammer just because not everything is a nail. &lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Thinking and Writing</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;I just learned about this blogging feature with Hey and am excited to give it a try. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have recognized over the past pandemic year that I’m not entirely happy with my personal learning. I thought that I would develop better systems and studies through a year spent inside, but that’s not been the case. It was often a year of apathy, anxiety, and worry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was also a year of real positive change in my own life, so it’s not all bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a mixed bag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I think that writing is a useful tool for thinking and sharpening understanding, so this new blogging tool may be just what I need to get the gears turning again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I keep things going, I want to work on the following things:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-building my engineering and industrial design skills by studying my textbooks  and creating technical posts to illustrate concepts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a career around the climate crisis by working in technical solutions, performing appropriate data analysis, and understanding policy and community to become an effective activist. I am naive as to how to best do these things, but I’m starting with notes and design docs and will iterate my way to being impactful. And I’ll be careful to just get out of the way when that’s the best thing I can do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build and use open source programmatic CAD tools. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create more written, video, and stream content relating to programming and engineering topics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to work on all of those things because they are important to me and be a I feel compelled to try make a positive difference in the world using my skills. No very original, but it’s true that I feel that way, so I’ll keep my reasons simple. At least for now. &lt;/div&gt;
